## Usage
 Input start data:
According to my variant - 24:
  >Numbers of garmonics = 6
  ><br/>Border frequency = 2100
  ><br/>Number of points = 256

<br/>After waiting for processing, we get 4 graphs:
<br/>-With our signal;
<br/>-With spectrum for discrete Fourier transform;
<br/>-With spectrum for fast Fourier transform;
<br/>-With spectrum for fast Fourier transform from numpy.fft;
